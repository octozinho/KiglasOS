# KiglasOS

## A concept(at least for now) system with very specific goals.

KiglasOS it's a **CONCEPT** system that I plan on working on very soon. It has very specific goals, and may not work for a lot of people.

1- Be flexible;
2- Be lightweight;
3- Be practical;
4- Be modern.

Not a lot of details on the moment, come back very later; this is a repo made just to protect KiglasOS' name.
